# COMMANDS TO CREATE NETWORK AND START THREE CONTAINERS: MYSQL, WORDPRESS AND PHPMYADMIN ON THE SAME NETWORK FOR CONNECTIVITY

## CREATE CUSTOM NETWORK (and assign "wordpress" as its name)


docker network create wordpress


1. START MYSQL CONTAINER (CUSTOM VERSION NUMBER 5.7) WITH 4 CUSTOM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES



docker run \
  --network wordpress \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-password \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpressdb \
  -e MYSQL_USER=wordpressusr \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpresspass \
  --name mysql \
  -d mysql:5.7



2. START WORDPRESS CONTAINER (CUSTOM VERSION NUMBER 5.4)



docker run \
  --network wordpress \
  --name wordpress \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -d wordpress:5.4



3. START PHPMYADMIN CONTAINER



docker run \
  --network wordpress \
  -p 8888:80 \
  -e PMA_HOST=mysql \
  --name phpmyadmin \
  -d phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin


## CHECK IF THE CONTAINERS HAVE BEEN CREATED AND ARE ON THE SAME NETWORK

## NOW IT'S TIME TO OPEN WORDPRESS: http://localhost:8080

## REMEMBER THAT THE "Database Host" IN THE INITIAL WORDPRESS SETUP FORM SHOULD BE:

"myslq" (or what you named the mysql container instance) NOT "localhost"

### YOUR JOB IS DONE - YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CREATED TWO CONTAINERS ON THE SAME CUSTOM NETWORK AND MAKE THEM TALK TO ONE ANOTHER
## ALL WORKED FINE IN MY CASE AND I AM ABLE TO LAUNCH A NEW WORDPRESS WEBSITE ON DOCKER
